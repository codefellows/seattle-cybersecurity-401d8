  - Augmenting a brute force attack tool with a password or username list.
- What is RockYou password list? Ref. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RockYou)
  - Once upon a time in 2005, a company called RockYou was founded that built widgets for social media pages.
  - "Data breach: In December 2009, the company experienced a data breach resulting in the exposure of over 32 million user accounts. The company used an unencrypted database to store user account data, including plaintext passwords (as opposed to password hashes) for its service, as well as passwords to connected accounts at partner sites (including Facebook, Myspace, and webmail services). RockYou would also e-mail the password unencrypted to the user during account recovery. They also did not allow using special characters in the passwords. The hackers used a 10-year-old SQL vulnerability to gain access to the database. The company took days to notify users after the incident, and initially incorrectly reported that the breach only affected older applications when it actually affected all RockYou users."
  - Their loss is our gain! Now we have access to a VERY useful password list in `rockyou.txt`.
