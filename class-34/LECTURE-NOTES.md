## Forensic Investigation with Autopsy

### Why (5 min)

- Why computer forensics?
  - Going to help you in situations where you answer the question "what happened on this device?"
  - Digital forensics is commonly used interchangeably but denotes a broader scope of work including all devices capable of storing digital information.
  > IT professionals can sometimes end up doing quite a lot of forensics work, such as chasing down a malicious process on an endpoint or investigating a user policy violation. Another example of why IT roles are "feeder" roles for security specialization.

### What (10 min)

  > Ever seen the show Dexter? The main character, Dexter Morgan, works as a Forensic Blood Spatter Analyst. The character is commonly called to crime scenes (after the crime occurs) to analyze the situation and then work to reverse-engineer in his lab environment what actually happened during the crime. Sound familiar?

    - The first rule of digital forensics is to **preserve the original evidence**
    - Protect original copies of data by making copies first
    - Integrity is everything!
    - Isolate, safeguard, and preserve the master copy
  - Analysis
    - Here's the part we'll be doing today in lab!
    - Construct a timeline of events
    - Build a picture of what happened
  - Documentation
    - Record, date & sign
  - Presentation
    - Present your findings without any bias or partiality
- What is Autopsy?
  - Open source forensics platform that comes bundled in FLARE VM
  - Analyze mobile devices and digital media
  - Used in law enforcement, national security, litigation support, and corporate investigation
  - Why use Autopsy over manual file navigation?
    - Multi-user cases, timeline analysis, registry analysis, keyword search, email analysis, media playback, EXIF analysis, malicious file detection
