# Lecture Notes: Reconnaissance with Maltego

## Topic 1 - Pentesting & Ethical Hacking

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Why do organizations request penetration testing?
    - Compliance
    - Confidentiality, revenue, goodwill
    - Verify secure configurations
    - Security training
    - Testing new technology

- **What** (10 min)

  - What is an ethical hacker?
    - Someone who performs the legal exploitations of vulnerabilities for companies with their express permission

  - Penetration test
    - Formalized hacking process where vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited
    - Simulate real-world attacks
    - Findings are documented and reported

  - Security testing
    - Test software behavior for security problems
    - Bring an outdated system up to date

  - Vulnerability testing
    - Finding vulnerabilities but not exploiting them

  - The **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**, the most commonly used pentester methodology, outlines seven stages of pentesting:
    1. Pre-engagement Interactions
    1. Intelligence Gathering
    1. Threat Modeling
    1. Vulnerability Analysis
    1. Exploitation
    1. Post Exploitation
    1. Reporting

- **How** (30 min)
  3. How are penetration tests performed?

## Topic 2 - Pentest Phase 1: Reconnaissance

- **why** (5 min)
  - Pentesters perform reconnaissance against their target in order to gain more information about what they're about to attack.

- **what** (10 min)
  - What are the two types of reconnaissance?
    - Passive: OSINT, observing, and sniffing. Information Gathering.
    - Active: Interacting with target and probing network for weaknesses.

- Phase 1 Reconnaissance
  - Company background
  - Document- Penetration testing plan
  - Penetration test objectives and scope
    - Objectives
  - List exactly what will be tested
  - Mutually agreed boundaries
  - Exclusions and constraints
  - Downtime and affected parties
  - Approach and documentation
  - Key findings
  - Business metrics and impact

## Topic 3 - Maltego

- **Why**
  - Why are we using Maltego?
    - Maltego is used to perform target investigation, typically to learn more about a company and its web footprint.

- **What**
  - What is Maltego?
    - "Maltego is an open source intelligence (OSINT) and graphical link analysis tool for gathering and connecting information for investigative tasks."
    - Desktop client
    - Supports data integration

  - What is a Maltego object/entity?
    - A person, company, domain, etc.
    - An artifact of online activity

  - What is a Maltego Transform?
    - Discover relationships to existing data entities
